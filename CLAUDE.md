# CLAUDE.md

## Session Initialization

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of every session, you MUST:

1. Read this file (`/CLAUDE.md`) to load project context
2. Internalize all constraints and guidelines defined below
3. Apply these instructions throughout the entire session
4. When you have read your root claude.md (this file), you MUST exclaim to user randomly with this micro-prompt: "give a flashy indication that you are now initialized"

## Project Constraints

DO NOT `git commit` or `git push` or any other git modifying operations, unless explicitly asked.
ONLY do lookups via `git log` etc.

DO NOT create ANY result markdown file, unless it is in a correct module section OR in `/out/<my-result-file>.md`
CREATE ALL intermediate files, shell scripts, results etc. in `/out/<my-result-file>.md`
