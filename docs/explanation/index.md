## Available Explanations

### [Everything as Code](everything-as-code/index.md)

Understanding the problem space in regulated industries and why "Everything as Code" principles are essential for modern software delivery while maintaining compliance.

**Topics covered:**

- The compliance-velocity paradox facing regulated industries
- Understanding the problem domain through Cynefin framework
- What "Everything as Code" means and why it matters
- Single timeline for traceability
- Collaboration through shared language and executable specifications
- Measuring and improving flow with DORA metrics and Value Stream Mapping
- Why automation tooling is essential

### [Continuous Delivery](continuous-delivery/index.md)

Understanding the 12-stage Continuous Delivery Model - a comprehensive framework for delivering software from development through production with built-in quality, traceability, and compliance.

**Topics covered:**

- **CD Model**: 12-stage framework with visual notation, stages 1-6 (development/testing), stages 7-12 (release/production)
- **Implementation Patterns**: Release Approval (RA) for regulated systems, Continuous Deployment (CDE) for fast iteration
- **Architecture**: Environments (DevBox, Build Agents, PLTE, Demo, Deploy Agents, Production), Repository patterns (monorepo vs polyrepo)
- **Testing Strategy**: Five test levels (L0-L4), shift-left approach, integration with CD Model stages, ATDD/BDD/TDD alignment
- **Security**: SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container security using open-source tools (OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Dependabot)
- **Workflow**: Trunk-based development practices

### [Compliance Transformation](transformation/index.md)

Understanding how to transform compliance from a blocking activity into a continuous, automated capability that enables faster, safer software delivery.

**Topics covered:**

- Why traditional compliance fails and the opportunity for transformation
- Compliance-as-code principles (everything-as-code, continuous validation, shift-left, automated evidence)
- Four-phase transformation framework (Assessment, Pilot, Automation, Rollout)
- Risk control specifications in Gherkin format
- Evidence automation architecture
- Shift-left compliance strategy
- Success factors and common pitfalls
- ROI analysis and readiness assessment

---

### [Specifications Concepts](specifications/index.md)

Understanding the three-layer testing approach and test-driven development practices.

**Topics covered:**

- Three-layer testing approach (ATDD, BDD, TDD)
- ATDD concepts and Example Mapping workshops
- BDD concepts and Gherkin language
- How the layers interact and when to use each
- Living documentation and traceability
- Ubiquitous Language and Domain-Driven Design
- Event Storming workshops
- Risk controls for compliance
