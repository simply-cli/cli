# Everything as Code

> **Turn every commit into deployable, compliant software you can trust**

## What is Everything as Code?

Everything as Code is an extensible CLI-in-a-box called r2r (Ready to Release) for managing software delivery flows with integrated MCP servers and VSCode extension. It brings continuous delivery, compliance automation, and executable specifications together into a unified workflow that works from your terminal, IDE, or CI/CD pipeline.

## Why Everything as Code?

Traditional compliance creates friction: manual documentation, periodic audits, late validation. Development teams wait for approvals. Compliance teams scramble during audit prep. Quality suffers.

Everything as Code transforms compliance from a bottleneck into an automated capability by:

- **Everything as Code** - Requirements, policies, and evidence in version control
- **Continuous Validation** - Compliance checked on every commit, not quarterly
- **Shift-Left Compliance** - Issues caught at commit time (5 minutes) vs. production (days)
- **Automated Evidence** - Evidence generated as a byproduct of your pipeline
- **Executable Specifications** - Requirements expressed as tests that validate your system

## Documentation Navigation

Documentation is organized using the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/):

### [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)

**Learning-oriented**: Step-by-step lessons for newcomers

Start here if you're new to the CLI and want hands-on guidance through core concepts and workflows.

### [How-to Guides](how-to-guides/index.md)

**Problem-oriented**: Recipes for specific tasks

Use these when you need to accomplish a specific task like writing specifications, setting up CI validation, or linking risk controls.

### [Reference](reference/index.md)

**Information-oriented**: Technical descriptions and specifications

Look here for command syntax, configuration options, Gherkin format details, and API specifications.

### [Explanation](explanation/index.md)

**Understanding-oriented**: Conceptual discussions and design rationale

Read these to understand the "why" behind continuous delivery models, compliance transformation, testing strategies, and architectural decisions.

**Choose based on what you need:**

- "I'm new and want to learn" → [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)
- "I need to accomplish a task" → [How-to Guides](how-to-guides/index.md)
- "I need technical details" → [Reference](reference/index.md)
- "I want to understand why" → [Explanation](explanation/index.md)
