## Navigation

Documentation is organized using the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/):

- **[Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)** - Learning-oriented: Step-by-step lessons for newcomers
- **[How-to Guides](how-to-guides/index.md)** - Problem-oriented: Recipes for specific tasks
- **[Reference](reference/index.md)** - Information-oriented: Technical descriptions and specifications
- **[Explanation](explanation/index.md)** - Understanding-oriented: Conceptual discussions and design rationale

**Choose based on what you need:**

- "I'm new and want to learn" → [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)
- "I need to accomplish a task" → [How-to Guides](how-to-guides/index.md)
- "I need technical details" → [Reference](reference/index.md)
