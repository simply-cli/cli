# DR-004: Adopt Diataxis Framework for Documentation Organization

## Status

- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Proposed
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

**Date**: 2025-11-03

## Context

Docs need to serve different user intents: learning, solving problems, understanding concepts, looking up details. Traditional flat/component-based structures don't map to these needs.

**Problem**: How to organize docs for different user needs with consistency and discoverability?

---

## Decision

**Diataxis framework** with four categories:

1. **Tutorials** (`docs/tutorials/`): Learning-oriented, step-by-step, little prior knowledge
2. **How-To Guides** (`docs/how-to-guides/`): Problem-oriented, single task, actionable steps
3. **Explanation** (`docs/explanation/`): Understanding-oriented, concepts, context, design
4. **Reference** (`docs/reference/`): Information-oriented, precise, comprehensive (e.g., `specifications/`, `decision-records/`)

**Structure**:

```text
docs/
├── tutorials/
├── how-to-guides/
├── explanation/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

---

## Consequences

**Positive**: Clear intent mapping, no duplication, category-specific quality, predictable structure, scalable, industry standard

**Negative**: Learning curve, navigation overhead, migration effort

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Flat Structure**: Rejected - hard to navigate, no learning path, scales poorly
2. **Component-Based**: Rejected - duplicates patterns, no intent guidance, mixes types
3. **README-Heavy**: Rejected - files become long, inconsistent, poor cross-referencing
4. **Wiki-Style**: Rejected - no structure, disorganized, hard to review, separate from code
