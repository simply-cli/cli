@risk-control:vuln-patching
Feature: Patch Management

  As a system administrator
  I want to implement Patch Management
  So that security and compliance requirements are met

  Rule: Control is implemented

    @risk-control:vuln-patching-01
    Scenario: Control is active
      Given the control is configured
      When the system operates
      Then the control requirements are enforced
      
    @risk-control:vuln-patching-02
    Scenario: Control prevents violations
      Given a user attempts to violate the control
      When the action is detected
      Then it is blocked and logged
